# courseradatascience_cleaningdata
Repository for the programming assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data (Module 3) of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera

This repository contains 1.) a R script that performs the required steps called run_analysis.R and 2.) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

If the following files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

1. features.txt
2. activity_labels.txt
3. subject_train.txt
4. X_train.txt
5. y_train.txt
6. subject_test.txt
7. X_test.txt
8. y_test.txt

are located in the working directory, then run_analysis.R can be run and will return an output named data_summary_means.txt.  The values in this file are described in the code book, CodeBook.md
